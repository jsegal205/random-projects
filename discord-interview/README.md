Interview Questions
Build an app from scratch using React and either Flux or Redux for state management.

- The app will have a button that when you click on it, a modal will open up.
- The modal will have two divs: one of the left side and one on the right.
  - The left side will have an input that allows a user to add a channel to the list.
  - Once a channel has been added and selected, the right side will have a text box with a save button so anytime a user edits the text in the text box and clicks Save, it will save to the state.
- When the modal closes, it should maintain the state and whatever channel was selected before the modal was closed. There are major bonus points for making the app look pretty.
